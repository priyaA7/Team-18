        <p> Hey! First of all, thank you so much for visiting our page! We hope our service is helpful, and aids you in your daily life! </p>
		<p> We decided to develop 'PEDALS' as we saw how much biking is involved in Vancouver's culture. Especially in the last few years, we have seen an
			influx of bikers, along with the greater development of bike lanes and services. We wanted to make something that can not only be helpful to 
			the bikers in Vancouver, but extend to other cities as well. 
		<p> 'PEDALS' allows users to find routes from an inputted location to an inputted destination.
			They are able to sort these routes by difficulty level, as best suited to their needs. Additionally, users can also find nearby rental services, parking
			and attractions. </p> 
		<p> We also hope this app encourages people to bike more often rather than using other forms of transportation, that can be harmful to the environment. Our goal is for 
		'PEDALS' to not only fit our users goals, but also fit Vancouver's eco-goals!</p>
